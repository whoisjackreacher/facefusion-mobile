/**
 * The NSFW content gate, with upstream's policy.
 *
 * It **blocks**: FaceFusion's `content_analyser.py` refuses to process flagged content and
 * so does this port (decided 2026-08-24). Everything here is upstream's rule, ported:
 *
 *  * a still is checked once ([checkImage], `analyse_image`);
 *  * a video is sampled **one frame per second** and refused when more than **10%** of the
 *    samples trip the gate ([checkVideo], `analyse_video`) -- not every frame, which is
 *    what makes a ~5 ms graph cost ~56 ms for a whole clip instead of 1.5 s.
 *
 * ⚠ **This port gates on `nsfw_2` alone.** Upstream votes 2-of-3 across `nsfw_1`, `nsfw_2`
 * and `nsfw_3`, which together are 461 MB against a 266 MB app. A single model cannot
 * reproduce a majority vote, and which way it errs is unmeasured. See docs/roadmap.md 2.
 *
 * ⚠ **A failure to measure is not permission.** `NativePipe.contentScore` returns NaN when
 * the graph did not run, and every verdict below treats NaN as [Verdict.ERROR], never as
 * "allow". A blocking gate that opens when it breaks is worse than no gate, because
 * everything upstream of it believes the content was checked.
